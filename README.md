Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

## Raw Data

The raw data is supplied in the compressed getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip.

This compressed ZIP file must be expanded into the current working directory i.e. alongside the R scripts, such that run_analysis.R and the UCI HAR Dataset directory are next to eachother.

## Tidy Data

Briefly, the tidy data in tidy_data_set.txt is a wide format file with a header row and 180 observations of 68 variables.

For me details, please refer to the code book

## The Code Book

Please see CodeBook.md

The code book details the treatment of the raw data, as implemented by the R script, to produce the tidy data.

Details of the tidy data are contain in the code book also.

## The R Script

Please see run_analysis.R

This script runs off the expanded raw data as described above.

The script will produce the tidy data, as describe above, in the tidy_data_set.txt file in the same directory as itself.
